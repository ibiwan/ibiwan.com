                <h2>Music of Tortuga</h2>
                <p>On a cold gloomy morning came upon we a port <br>our spirits were low and our supplies were short.
                    <br>Storm had just ended leaving need for repair <br>when we heard the sweet music drifting up
                    <br>through the air.
                <p>Well our hearts warmed with hope when we saw the dim light <br>that shown through the fog like the
                    <br>stars in the night <br>Then came a call from the crow's nest above, <br>"Me lads this be the
                    port
                    <br>Tortuga!"
                <p>Now a ship of the fleet would be not welcome here <br>so we cut some dark canvas we'd stowed with the
                    <br>gear <br>and with some white washing that we had aboard <br>we painted a visage of skull and
                    crossed
                    <br>sword
                <p>When the gangplank hit dock we let out a cheer <br>our thoughts turned to women to food and to beer.
                    <br>We ran for the taverns like children to faire <br>"Me lads welcome the port Tortuga!"
                <p class="chorus">We ate, we drank, we danced and sang <br>me boys sing "Tu-ra-lu-ra" <br>The tankards
                    <br>clanked and the headboards banged <br>to the music of Tortuga
                <p>And so by the time that the sun it went down <br>we was all good and drunk and were stumbling around.
                    <br>Wide swung the door and our captain walked in <br>he looked at us all and he said with a grin,
                <p>"Such a sorry lot I never did see <br>you call yourselves sailors you're no good to me" <br>"Well sir
                    <br>me captain this port it ain't Rome <br>No sir this be the port Tortuga!
                <p class="chorus">We ate we drank we danced and sang <br>me boys sing "Tu-ra-lu-ra" <br>The tankards
                    <br>clanked and the headboards banged <br>to the music of Tortuga.
                <p>And so for a fortnight we worked all day long <br>and spent our nights drinking with women and song.
                    <br>Traded some cargo for rigging and nails <br>and cut some clean canvas to patch up our sails
                <p>On the night that we set out for the fleet of our queen <br>and every night since when I lay down to
                    <br>dream <br>out in the darkness I swear I can hear <br>that sweet music of Tortuga.
                <p class="chorus">We ate we drank we danced and sang <br>me boys sing "Tu-ra-lu-ra" <br>The tankards

                <p>When the hands were raised by the morning light

                    <br>By the Devil's eye they're in for a fight
                    <br>So hoist our colors true...

                <p>Sailing hard and fast on a downward tack
                    <br>Bearing 16 guns 'neath a flag of black
                    <br>Boys now there ain't no looking back
                    <br>Upon the sea so blue...

                <p>True, the sea was calm and the wind was fair
                    <br>When the orders came "fire as you bear!"
                    <br>To cripple the bitch and collect our share

                    <br>To Glory We Steer...

                <p>With the first volley like a toppling crown
                    <br>Her whole main yard came crashing down
                    <br>Like an eager harlot's evening gown
                    <br>And her mizzen split in two...

                <p>Then through the smoke came her reply
                    <br>A ragged tattoo shook the pale blue sky
                    "helm a lee" came the bosun's cry
                    "May the Dragon get her due!"

                <p>We came about with cannons bared
                    <br>Long orange tongues licked at the air
                    <br>And the swivels caught them unaware
                    <br>As the grape shot ripped right through...

                <p>Our Captain raised his flashing sword
                    <br>And the call came down "prepare to board!"
                    <br>The crew at arms reared back and roared
                    "The Dragon's come for you!"

                <p>On the quarter deck begun the fight
                    <br>With pistol fire and cutlass might
                    <br>And their Captain's face went lily white
                    <br>When our master ran him through...

                <p>With the crew dispatched, we checked the hold
                    <br>Found sugar, rum, and Spanish gold

                <p>In the year of our lord eighteen hundred and six
                    <br>we set sail from the cold quay of Cork (cold Cork!)
                    <br>we were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
                    <br>for the grand city hall in New York
                    <br>we'd an elegant craft she was rigged fore-and-aft
                    <br>and oh how the trade winds drove her
                    <br>she had twenty three masts and she 'stood several blasts
                    <br>And they called her the Irish Rover

                <p>We had one million bags of our best sligo rags
                    <br>we had two million barrels of stone
                    <br>we had three million sides of old blind horse's hides
                    <br>we had four million barrels of bone
                    <br>we had five million hogs and six million dogs
                    <br>and seven million barrels of porter
                    <br>we had eight million bales of old nanny goats tails
                    <br>in the hold of the Irish Rover

                <p>There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
                    <br>there was Hogan from County Tyrone
                    <br>There was Dudley McGurk who was scared stiff of work
                    <br>and our chaplin from Meath called Malone
                    <br>there was Slugger O' Tool who was drunk as a rule
                    <br>and Fightin' Bill Tracy from Dover
                    <br>and your Man Mick McCann from the banks of the Bann
                    <br>was the skipper of the Irish Rover

                <p>We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
                    <br>and our ship lost her way in a fog (great fog!)
                    <br>and that whale of a crew was reduced down to two
                    <br>just meself and the captain's old dog (big dog!)
                    <br>well the ship struck a rock, oh lord what a shock
                    <br>and nearley tumbled over
                    <br>turned nine times around,
                    <br>and the poor old dog was drowned...

                <p>I was born in the galley of a cargo ship
                    <br>that they called the Southern Star
                    <br>I was raised on the reading of the word of God
                    <br>counting cards and tending bar.

                <p>The mast was my steeple, the poop deck my pew,
                    <br>my bishop was a mouse.
                    <br>Scurvy and starvation were my congregation
                    <br>til I bought a public house.

                <p class="chorus">Now it's Ho-Heave-Ho and ya Raise a glass
                    <br>And you'll never be a failure
                    <br>It's easy to be the Parson of the Pub
                    <br>When you grew up preaching to the sailors.

                <p>My daddy was an English protestant
                    <br>My mother was a Scot.
                    <br>I thought I would wear the pants in my clan
                    <br>but this Kilt was all I got.

                <p>They asked me which block was my favorite flock
                    <br>ever since I was a nipper.
                    <br>Puritans, I confess, will make a smaller mess,
                    <br>but Catholics are much better tippers.

                <p class="chorus">And it's Ho-Heave-Ho and ya Raise a glass
                    <br>And you'll never be a loser
                    <br>It's easy to be the Parson of the Pub
                    <br>Cause a beggar cannot be a chooser.

                <p>The stated position of the Inquisition
                    <br>is I should go underground.
                    <br>As long as I'm gone before they flame on,
                    <br>I'll be safe and sound.

                <p>My religious views may not be big news
                    <br>but still they get people thinkin'.
                    <br>Cause mercy is mercy, the word is the truth,
                    <br>and everyone's blessed when you're drinkin!

                <p class="chorus">And it's Ho-Heave-Ho and ya Raise a glass
                    <br>And you never can deny it.
                    <br>It's easy to be the Parson of the Pub
                    <br>The hard part is keepin' it quiet.

                <p>Now I don't get nervous when folks ask for service
                    <br>I just keep it straight in my head:
                    <br>You don't read Last Rites to the bride and the groom
                    <br>and you don't baptize someone who's dead.

                <p>A man came to christen, my holy water's missin'
                    <br>and my wellspring ran unclear,
                    <br>but he was a sinner in need of salvation
                    <br>so I baptized him with beer.

                <p class="chorus">And it's Ho-Heave-Ho and ya Raise a glass
                    <br>And you'll never have to fear it.
                    <br>It's easy to be the Parson of the Pub
                    <br>Cause everybody's in the spirit!

                <p>When I first encountered Captain Micky Slinger
                    <br>he showed me his pistol and sword.
                    <br>So he keeps me in silver and spice from the East
                    <br>and I keeps him right with the Lord.

                <p>Cause two Charlie Pirates were gambling one night
                    <br>with our drunken Irish Bard,
                    <br>So I fed them mead and whiskey and beer
                    <br>and fed Mick some extra cards.

                <p class="chorus">And it's Ho-Heave-Ho and ya Raise a glass
                    <br>And you'll never be decoded
                    <br>It's easy to be the Parson of the Pub
                    <br>Cause the patrons aren't the only thing that's loaded!

                <p>So love your fellow man. That is the holy plan
                    <br>and the recipe for great fun.
                    <br>So let's raise a toast to the Holy Ghost
                    <br>to the Father and to the Son.

                <p>And tonight we'll cavort with the girls of the Court
                    <br>and we'll drink with our bretheren.
                    <br>So let's finish Mass and fill up your glass
                    <br>and somebody say A-Men! (Amen!)

                <p class="chorus">And it's Ho-Heave-Ho and ya Raise a glass
                    <br>And you'll never be a liar
                    <br>It's easy to be the Parson of the Pub
                    <br>Cause you're always preaching to the Choir!
